      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        To begin let me explain that two major events in my life have ultimately shaped my world view. 
        In high school I received a scholarship to spend a full year studying in Nagoya, Japan. 
        I studied endlessly, trying to absorb as much information and culture as I could. 
        This first glimpse living in such a different culture reinvented my curiosity and encouraged me to learn more about the world.<br>
        <br>
        Following this pattern I resolved to study abroad again in college. This time I set my sights on Germany, to deepen my understanding of the language and gain an insight to the European mindset.
        I completely changed as a person. My goals, my interests, my passions, all shaped again by new forms of literature and opinions. 
        What I learned most of all, was to draw parallels from my love for natural languages to other fields. Above all, I decided that learning a language is all about problem-solving, troubleshooting, and the drive to learn continuously.<br>
        <br>
        This inevitably led me to the field of information technology, where these characteristics can play a steady role in developing a strong career.
